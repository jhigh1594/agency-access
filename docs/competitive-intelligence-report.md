## 2. AgencyAccess Analysis

### Company Overview
- **Founded**: ~2024 (newer entrant)
- **Location**: US-based
- **Position**: "Leadsie alternative"
- **Active competitor comparison content** (Feb 3, 2026 publication)

### Platform Coverage
- **25+ integrations** claimed
- Focus on same core platforms as Leadsie
- SEO agency-specific landing page

### Observed Positioning
- Positioning directly against Leadsie with comparison content
- Emphasizing SEO agency use case
- Actively creating competitive comparison content

### Intelligence Gaps
- Pricing not publicly available
