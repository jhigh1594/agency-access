# How to get access to Shopify Stores

To request access to a client's store, you will need a Shopify Partners account ([Set up a free account here](https://partners.shopify.com/)). Shopify Partner accounts allow you to manage clients at scale and assign internal access easily.

Once your client goes through the steps with Leadsie, you'll get an **email with the clients' Shopify store ID and collaborator code:**

## How to request access to the store using these details:

**Step 1:** Follow the link ['Request access to store](https://partners.shopify.com/current/stores/new?store_type=managed_store)' or go to **Stores** > **Add store** > **Add store** > **Request access to store** to the Shopify Partner Dashboard

**Step 2:** Add the URL and the collaborator code as per the information you received through Leadsie

**Step 3:** Click "Select all" permissions, or choose the specific permissions you need

**Step 5:** Your client will receive an email (example below) and a notification on their Shopify dashboard to tell them you've requested access. Once they confirm, you'll receive a confirmation again via email and see them in your Shopify partners dashboard.

If you manage assets for more than one Shopify store, you can see them all in the **Stores** tab of your Partner Dashboard, here you can modify your requests:
