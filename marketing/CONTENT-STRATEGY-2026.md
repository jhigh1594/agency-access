# Content Strategy 2026

**Agency Access Platform - Content Strategy for Market Positioning**

**Created**: February 14, 2026
**Based on**: Competitive Intelligence Report, Product Roadmap 2026
**Target Launch**: Q1 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**Content Mission**: Establish AuthHub.co as the authoritative voice on agency client onboarding by creating content that captures competitive search intent, demonstrates our unique value (access + intake), and builds trust with US digital marketing agencies.

**Primary Goals**:
1. **Capture competitive search traffic** - "Leadsie alternative" and comparison terms
2. **Educate on combined workflow** - Access + intake in one link
3. **Build authority** - Become the go-to resource for agency onboarding best practices
4. **Drive qualified trials** - Content → comparison pages → free trial

**Content Philosophy**: Be searchable first (capture existing demand), then shareable (create new demand). Every piece must answer a real question agencies are asking.

## Target Audience

### Primary Persona: Growing Agency Owner

**Demographics**:

- "Clients never fill out the forms I send them"

**Language Patterns** (voice of customer):

- "One link for everything"

### Secondary Persona: Enterprise Agency Operations

**Demographics**:
- Agency size: 50-200 employees
- Role: VP Operations, Director of Client Services
- Needs: SSO, API, compliance documentation, white-label

**Pain Points**:

## Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: Competitive Alternatives (Highest Priority)

**Target Keywords**:
- "Leadsie alternative" (high intent)
- "agency client onboarding software"
- "Leadsie pricing" (comparison)
- "Leadsie vs [competitor]"

**Content Cluster**:
