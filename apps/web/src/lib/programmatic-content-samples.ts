## Why Pinterest Ads Access Is Different

Pinterest's advertising platform has grown 50% year-over-year, making it essential for e-commerce and lifestyle agencies. But the access process differs from Meta and Google in key ways.

### The Pinterest Business Account Structure

Unlike Google's MCC or Meta's Business Manager, Pinterest uses a simpler model:

\`\`\`
Pinterest Business Account
  ├── Ad Accounts (one per business)
  ├── Boards & Pins
  └── User Access (email-based)
\`\`\`

**Key difference**: Pinterest doesn't have a centralized agency dashboard. Each client account must be accessed individually.

## Step-by-Step: Manual Access Request

### Step 1: Verify Business Account

Have your client confirm they have a **Pinterest Business Account** (not personal):
1. Log into Pinterest
2. Click profile → Settings
3. Look for "Account settings" → "Business information"

### Step 2: Add Agency User

In Pinterest Business Hub:
1. Go to **Ads** → **Advertiser details**
2. Click **Add people**
3. Enter your agency email
4. Select permission level:
   - **Analyst**: View reports only
   - **Creative**: Create pins, view reports
   - **Admin**: Full access including billing

### Step 3: Accept Invitation

You'll receive an email invitation. Click the link to accept access.

## Common Pinterest Access Issues

### Issue 1: "No Business Account Found"

**Solution**: The client has a personal Pinterest account. They need to convert it:
- Go to Settings → Account settings
- Click "Convert to business account"
- Complete the business profile

### Issue 2: Personal vs. Business Email

**Solution**: Pinterest access is tied to email addresses. Use your **agency email** (not personal) for all client access.

### Issue 3: Multiple Ad Accounts

**Solution**: Some businesses have multiple Pinterest ad accounts. Ensure the client adds you to the **correct** account by checking the Advertiser ID.

## Pinterest vs. Other Platforms: Access Comparison

| Platform | Agency Dashboard | Permission Levels | OAuth Support |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Pinterest | ❌ No | 3 | ✅ Yes |
| Meta | ✅ Business Manager | 4 | ✅ Yes |
| Google | ✅ MCC | 4 | ✅ Yes |
| LinkedIn | ❌ No | 3 | ✅ Yes |
| TikTok | ✅ Business Center | 3 | ✅ Yes |

## A Better Way: Single-Link Authorization

Instead of sending instructions for each platform, use AuthHub to send **one link** that handles:

- Pinterest Ads
- Meta (Facebook, Instagram)
- Google (Ads, GA4, GTM)
- LinkedIn Ads
- TikTok Ads
- And 10+ more platforms

**47 email threads → 1 link. 3 days → 5 minutes.**

## Pinterest Access Best Practices

### For Agencies:

✅ **Do**:
- Use a dedicated agency email for all Pinterest access
- Request Creative or Admin level (Analyst is too limited)
- Document which Pinterest accounts you have access to
- Set up two-factor authentication on your agency Pinterest account

❌ **Don't**:
- Never ask for client Pinterest passwords
- Don't use personal Pinterest accounts for client work
- Avoid requesting Admin access unless you need to manage billing

### For Clients:

✅ **Do**:
- Use your business email for the Pinterest account
- Grant Creative access for agencies (can create content but can't touch billing)
- Review active users quarterly
- Keep your Pinterest account verified

❌ **Don't**:
- Never share Pinterest login credentials
- Don't mix personal and business Pinterest accounts
- Avoid granting Admin access to agencies you don't fully trust

## Key Takeaways

- Pinterest access is simpler than Meta/Google but lacks centralized management
- 3 permission levels: Analyst (view), Creative (create), Admin (full)
- Always use business emails for agency access
- Automation platforms can eliminate manual access requests entirely
