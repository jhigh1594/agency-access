    question: "How does the 14-day free trial work?",
    answer: "The Growth plan includes a 14-day free trial with full access to all features—no credit card required. After the trial, you can subscribe to Growth, upgrade to Scale, or continue with our Free tier (1 active client).",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Free, Growth, and Scale?",
    answer: "Free is for solo freelancers testing the platform with 1 client and core platforms (Meta, Google, LinkedIn). Growth ($30/mo yearly) is for small teams with 5 clients/month, white-label branding, and 3 team seats. Scale ($70/mo yearly) is for established agencies with 15 clients/month, custom domain, API access, 10 team seats, and multi-brand support.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change plans later?",
    answer: "Yes! Upgrade or downgrade anytime. When upgrading, you'll be prorated for the remainder of your billing cycle. When downgrading, you'll receive credit towards future billing. Your existing clients continue working without interruption.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I hit my monthly client limit?",
    answer: "We'll notify you when you're approaching your limit. You can upgrade to the next tier instantly—no data loss, no interruption. Existing client connections remain active regardless of your plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer discounts for annual billing?",
    answer: "Yes! Annual billing saves you ~25% compared to monthly. Growth drops from $40/mo to $30/mo, and Scale drops from $93/mo to $70/mo. Most agencies choose annual for the savings.",
  },
  {
    question: "How secure is my OAuth data?",
    answer: "We use bank-level encryption via Infisical to store all OAuth tokens. We're SOC 2 Type II compliant and GDPR ready. We never store tokens directly in our database—only secure references to encrypted vault storage.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my own domain with white-label?",
    answer: "Scale plan includes custom domain support (e.g., access.youragency.com). Both Growth and Scale include white-label branding with your logo, colors, and styling. Free tier has basic branding only.",
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms do you support?",
    answer: "Free tier includes core platforms: Meta, Google, and LinkedIn. Growth and Scale plans unlock all integrations including TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Beehiiv, Kit, and Zapier—plus custom integrations on Scale.",
