# Product Roadmap 2026

**Agency Access Platform - Strategic Differentiation Roadmap**

**Created**: February 14, 2026
**Based on**: Competitive Intelligence Report (docs/competitive-intelligence-report.md)
**Time Horizon**: 12 months (Q1-Q4 2026)

---

## Executive Summary

**Strategic Direction**: Position Agency Access Platform as the "Complete Client Onboarding Platform" - combining access requests + intake forms with predictable flat-rate pricing.

**Why This Direction**:
1. Leadsie (market leader) lacks integrated intake forms - agencies must use separate tools
2. Credit-based pricing creates "overage anxiety" - flat-rate is a clear differentiator
3. Combined access+intake workflow creates defensible product moat
4. Aligns with existing technical infrastructure

**Expected Outcomes (12 months)**:
- MRR: $10K → $50K
- Trial conversion: 15% → 20%
- G2 reviews: 0 → 50 (4.8+ rating)
- "Leadsie alternative" keyword: Top 3 ranking
- Access issue support load: -40% per 100 onboarding requests
- Scale tier white-label activation depth: 0% → 30%

## Competitive Positioning

### Differentiation Pillars

| Pillar | Our Position | Leadsie Weakness |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Completeness** | Access + Intake in One Link | Two-step process (separate intake tool) |
| **Predictability** | Flat-rate, no credits | Credit anxiety, surprise overages |
| **Customization** | Deep branding, your wording | Generic, limited options |
| **Access** | API on all tiers | Enterprise-only API |

### Positioning Statement

> **For** digital marketing agencies onboarding 3+ clients monthly
> **who** are frustrated with unpredictable costs and two-step processes
> **AuthHub.co** is the complete client onboarding platform
> **that** combines access requests AND intake forms in one professional link
> **unlike** Leadsie's credit-based pricing and separate intake tools
> **our solution** offers predictable flat-rate pricing with everything included.

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
