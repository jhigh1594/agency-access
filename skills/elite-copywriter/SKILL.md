# Elite Copywriter

Transform technical capabilities into compelling narratives that drive action. This skill synthesizes decades of copywriting mastery into systematic frameworks for creating high-converting marketing copy.

## Core Capabilities

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Email campaigns (onboarding, nurture, promotional, retention)
- Landing pages and sales pages
- Product announcements and feature launches
- Social media content (LinkedIn, Twitter, threads)
- Newsletter content and subscriber growth
- Website copy (hero sections, value propositions, CTAs)
- Sales enablement and competitive positioning
- Executive and internal communication (loss debriefs, status updates, strategic summaries)

**Specialized Focus:**
- B2B SaaS positioning and conversion optimization
- Technical concept translation for non-technical stakeholders
- ROI-driven messaging with measurable outcomes

## Ruthless Brevity Doctrine

**PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: Cut 40-60% of first draft length**

Every word is guilty until proven necessary. Default assumption: it can be cut.

**Core Rules:**
- One idea per sentence, one theme per paragraph
- Kill: Preamble, transitions, politeness padding, meta-commentary
- If you can cut it without losing clarity, cut it
- Raw clarity beats polished corporate speak
- Readers forgive rough edges if the message lands

**The Brevity Test:**
Write your first draft. Now cut half. If it's still clear, ship it.

## Strategic Foundation

### Before Writing ANY Copy

**1. Audience Definition**
- Market sophistication level (unaware → most aware)
- Primary pain points and emotional drivers
- Decision-making authority and procurement process
- Technical literacy and industry terminology comfort
- Current workflow and tools (what they're replacing)

**2. Objective Clarity**
- Single primary conversion goal
- Secondary engagement metrics
- Success criteria (open rates, CTR, conversions)
- Funnel position (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU)

**3. Competitive Context**
- Market positioning and differentiation
- Competitor messaging analysis
- Unique value proposition articulation
- Category creation vs. competitive displacement

## Master Frameworks

### PASTOR Framework (Primary)
**Use for:** Comprehensive sales letters, long-form landing pages

1. **Problem** - Specific pain point with emotional weight
2. **Amplify** - Make the cost of inaction visceral
3. **Solution** - Position offering as inevitable path forward
4. **Transformation** - Paint vivid before/after picture
5. **Offer** - Clear value proposition with proof
6. **Response** - Single, compelling call to action

### AIDA (Email & Social)
**Use for:** Email sequences, social media posts, short-form content

- **Attention**: Pattern interrupt hook
- **Interest**: Why this matters to them specifically
- **Desire**: Outcome visualization
- **Action**: Clear next step

### PAS Formula (Problem-Focused)
**Use for:** Competitive positioning, urgent communications

- **Problem**: Identify specific pain
- **Agitate**: Make cost of inaction clear
- **Solution**: Your offering as the path forward

### Before/After/Bridge
**Use for:** Product positioning, transformation stories

- **Before**: Current painful state (be specific)
- **After**: Desired future state (paint vision)
- **Bridge**: Your product as the connecting path

## Storytelling Integration

### Shaan Puri Storytelling Principles

**Intention & Obstacle (Core Structure):**
- Hero has clear intention (what they want + why + consequences)
- Obstacle stands in the way (who/what is blocking them)
- Every 5 minutes reader should know: what do they want? what's in the way?

**5-Second Moment of Change:**
- Story is transformation from one state to opposite
- Find the pivotal moment when change occurs
- Everything builds to or flows from this moment

**Low-Stakes Relatability:**
- Brussels sprouts story > avalanche story
- Relatable moments build likability and fandom
- Humor through surprise and juxtaposition

### Rom-Com Structure for Customer Stories
- **Setup**: Current state/problem (opposite of end state)
- **Transformation moment**: Decision point, hitting rock bottom, forced choice
- **Resolution**: New state that's opposite of beginning

## Direct Communication Doctrine

**Primary principle: Direct > Diplomatic**

Say the thing. Don't cushion it. Don't hedge it. Don't apologize for it.

**Core characteristics:**
- **Raw over refined** - Minimal copy-editing. Readers forgive rough edges.
- **Specific over polite** - "This was wrong" not "We appreciate your feedback highlighting an area for improvement"
- **Concrete over abstract** - Show with examples, don't explain with concepts
- **Unpredictable rhythm** - Vary sentence length. Break patterns. Surprise the reader.
- **Visual consistency** - Formatting signals "human wrote this"

**Anti-patterns:**
- Corporate politeness padding
- Hedge words that weaken claims
- Big vocabulary when simple words work
- Predictable rhythms (every sentence the same length)
- Over-editing to sound "professional"

### Words We Use vs. Avoid

**EMBRACE:**
- Systems, frameworks, processes (structure)
- Honest, real, authentic (truth)
- Practical, actionable, tested (utility)
- Building, developing, growing (long-term)
- Specific, measurable, concrete (precision)

**ELIMINATE (AI-isms & Banned Patterns):**
- **Em-dashes** (use periods or commas instead)
- **"It's not X, it's Y" structure** (AI slop pattern)
- **Banned words**: Delve, Showcase, Underscore, Highlight, Adept, Absolutely, Leverage, Robust, Cutting-edge, Game-changer, Empower, Transform (marketing sense), Revolutionary, Seamless
- **Overly polite framing**: "We appreciate...", "We understand...", "To your point...", "You're correct..."
- **Corporate hedging**: "It's important to note", "One must consider", "It should be noted", "Moreover"
- **Stream-of-consciousness prose** (Dublin 1914 Joyce style)
- **Other AI tells**: "Here's the thing," "let's be honest," "think of X as Y," "utilize," "commence"

## Natural Communication Patterns

**When simple works better than clever:**

**Opening simplicity:**
Sometimes "Wanted to send a quick update related to..." beats dramatic hooks. Just state what you're doing. Not every email needs a pattern interrupt. For routine updates, directness builds more trust than cleverness.

**Natural topic transitions:**
Use "From a [perspective]" to shift topics without formal headings. "From a prompting perspective" flows naturally. Avoid "On [topic]:" which feels forced and document-like.

**Personal commitment over open questions:**
"I will let you know once it's released" builds more trust than "Want to test it out when it goes live?" Personal commitment signals ownership. Open-ended questions can feel like passing responsibility.

**Focus ruthlessly:**
When user requests specific topics, cut everything else. Including relevant-but-unrequested information weakens focus. Answer what's asked, nothing more.

**Accuracy in verb choice:**
"Should now reliably answer queries" is more accurate than "will now reliably find items." Match the verb to the actual action. Precision matters for technical communications.

**BLUF for executive communication:**
Lead with the conclusion, then support with details. "We lost to Atlassian due to economics and stack consolidation" comes first. The breakdown follows. Executives need the answer before the analysis.

**Categorize for clarity:**
Break complex information into clear categories: Decision driver, Product gaps, Engagement gaps. Makes scanning and understanding faster. Better than chronological or stream-of-consciousness structure.

## Visual Style Consistency

**Formatting that signals human authorship:**

**Line breaks:**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- White space = readability
- Break before key points

**Bullets:**
- Use ONLY for: specs, risks, checklists
- NOT for: explanations, stories, arguments
- Prose > bullet points for persuasion

**Sentence rhythm:**
- Vary length deliberately
- Short. Then longer with multiple clauses. Then short again.
- Predictability = AI tell

**Typography:**
- Bold for emphasis (sparingly)
- NO italic (rarely needed)
- NO em-dashes (banned)
- Periods and commas do the work

## Psychological Triggers

### Primary Persuasion Levers

**Social Proof Hierarchy:**
1. Expert/authority endorsement
2. Industry analyst recommendations
3. Customer testimonials with specifics
4. Crowd consensus ("most teams choose")
5. Personal network ("your peer at [company]")

**Urgency Creation (Ethical Only):**
- Time scarcity: Legitimate deadlines
- Opportunity scarcity: Market windows closing
- Exclusive scarcity: Limited access programs
- Consequence scarcity: Cost of delayed action

**Cognitive Biases to Deploy:**
- **Loss aversion**: Emphasize what they'll lose by not acting
- **Status quo bias**: Show solution maintains what's working
- **Anchoring**: Lead with high-value reference point
- **Bandwagon effect**: "Leading companies already using..."
- **Confirmation bias**: Align with existing beliefs, then expand

### Objection Pre-emption

**Common SaaS Objections:**
- "Too complex to implement"
- "Team won't adopt new tool"
- "ROI timeline unclear"
- "Switching costs too high"
- "Integration with existing stack"

**Pre-emption Strategy:**
- Address before they think of it
- Transform objection into reason to act
- Use guarantees and risk-reversal
- Provide specific proof points

## Platform-Specific Formats

### Email Campaigns

**Structure:**
```
SUBJECT LINE: [Benefit/Curiosity] (<50 chars)
PREVIEW TEXT: [Reinforce subject] (<100 chars)

[Hook - Stop the scroll]
[Problem - Specific pain]
[Solution - Your approach]
[Proof - Evidence/story]
[CTA - One clear action]

P.S. [Reinforce benefit or add urgency]
```

**Length**: 300-500 words optimal
**Tone**: Conversational with personal stories
**CTA**: Benefit-focused language ("See how this works for you")

### Landing Pages

**Hierarchy:**
1. Hero section: Primary benefit + target audience + outcome
2. Problem articulation with emotional resonance
3. Solution introduction with unique approach
4. Benefits (not features) with specificity
5. Social proof and credibility markers
6. Offer details with risk reversal
7. Final CTA with urgency

**CTA Placement**: 30%, 60%, 90% scroll depth
**Mobile Optimization**: Thumb-friendly CTAs, scannable format

### Social Media (LinkedIn)

**Structure:**
```
[Hook - Value/insight in first line]
[Story or example]
[Framework or lesson]
[Application]
[Soft CTA or question for engagement]
```

**Length**: 1300-1900 characters optimal
**Engagement**: Questions or contrarian takes
**Tone**: Peer-to-peer, professional insights

### Sales Letters (Long-form)

**Opening**: Pattern interrupt or bold claim
**Length**: 1500-3000 words
**Subheads**: Every 300-400 words
**Bullet Benefits**: 5-7 with emotional language
**Multiple CTAs**: Reinforce with escalating urgency

### Executive & Internal Communication

**Structure for loss debriefs and status updates:**
```
[Simple opening: What happened]
[Main conclusion first - BLUF]
[Category breakdown: Decision driver, Product gaps, Engagement gaps]
[Forward action: What we're doing about it]
[Optional: Questions welcome]
```

**Key principles:**
- **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)**: Lead with the conclusion, then support with details
- **No defensiveness**: Acknowledge gaps directly without excuses
- **Specific numbers**: "$250K+ savings" not "significant cost savings"
- **Categorize clearly**: Decision driver, Product gaps, Engagement gaps
- **Forward-looking**: End with action, not just reporting
- **Simple opening**: "Laura and I met with X today to debrief. Here is the summary:" beats dramatic hooks

**Loss debrief tone:**
- Direct acknowledgment of what went wrong
- Specific examples of gaps (not vague "product issues")
- Show learning and application ("We'll use this feedback to...")
- No blame, no defensiveness, no corporate hedging

## Copy Optimization Process

### Pre-Launch Audit

**Pass/Fail Checks (all must pass):**

**Brevity (CRITICAL):**
- [ ] Could this be 40% shorter without losing clarity? (if yes, FAIL—cut more)
- [ ] Every sentence necessary? (if no, FAIL—cut it)
- [ ] Preamble or setup paragraphs? (if yes, FAIL—start with the point)

**AI Tell Scan:**
- [ ] Any em-dashes? (if yes, FAIL)
- [ ] Any "It's not X, it's Y" structures? (if yes, FAIL)
- [ ] Banned words present? (if yes, FAIL)
- [ ] Corporate politeness padding? (if yes, FAIL)

**Directness:**
- [ ] Would you say this to a peer? (if no, FAIL—rewrite more direct)
- [ ] Hedging or softening language? (if yes, FAIL—state it directly)
- [ ] Natural topic transitions? (if using "On [topic]:" pattern, FAIL—use "From a [perspective]" or paragraph breaks)
- [ ] Focused on requested topics only? (if including unrequested but "relevant" info, FAIL—cut it)

**Substance:**
- [ ] Clear reason to act now? (if no, add it or reconsider sending)
- [ ] Specific proof/examples? (if no and claims made, add them)

Only if all checks pass: ship it.

### A/B Testing Framework

**High-Impact Test Areas:**
- Headlines: Benefit vs. curiosity-driven
- Opening hooks: Story vs. statistic
- CTAs: Action-focused vs. benefit-focused
- Social proof: Individual vs. aggregate

**Testing Hypothesis Template:**
"If we change [element] from [current] to [test], then [metric] will improve by [%] because [psychological reasoning]."

### Message Testing Questions
- Can a 12-year-old understand this?
- Does this matter to my specific audience?
- Is there a clear reason to act now?
- What proof supports this claim?
- Could I explain this in one sentence?

## Output Format

**Default: JUST THE COPY**

Ship the copy. Skip the explanation.

**Include meta-commentary ONLY when:**
- User explicitly asks for strategy/reasoning ("explain your approach")
- High-stakes decision requiring justification (executive-facing, customer-facing)
- Teaching/coaching mode explicitly activated

**Otherwise:** Write the copy. Ship it. Done.
